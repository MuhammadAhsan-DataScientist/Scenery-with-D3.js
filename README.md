# Scenery-with-D3.js
Experience a serene countryside scene with D3.js, featuring a house, fluffy clouds, a lush tree, a sun, cars on a winding road, and a peaceful sky.
This project is an animated scenery created for a university assignment using D3.js. The scene includes:

    A cozy house
    Fluffy clouds
    A green tree
    A bright sun
    A road with cars
    A peaceful sky

The main animations are focused on the car lights and the white path markings on the road. This project demonstrates the use of D3.js to add dynamic elements to a tranquil countryside setting.
